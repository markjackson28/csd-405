### Program 1: ArrayList and Exception Handling

#### Program Overview
This Java program demonstrates the use of an `ArrayList` to store strings and the handling of user input to access and display a specific element from the list. It showcases key concepts such as the use of loops for data manipulation, exception handling for robust error management, and basic user interaction through the console.

#### Features
- Creation of an `ArrayList` filled with strings.
- Use of a 'for-each' loop to iterate over and print the `ArrayList` contents.
- Interaction with the user to select an element to view.
- Exception handling to manage out-of-bounds access attempts.

#### How to Compile and Run
1. **Compiling the Program**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `ArrayListLab.java`.
   - Compile the program using the Java compiler:
     ```sh
     javac ArrayListLab.java
     ```

2. **Running the Program**
   - After compilation, run the program with Java Runtime:
     ```sh
     java ArrayListLab
     ```
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the program.

#### Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Program 2: File Creation, Writing, and Reading

#### Program Overview
This Java application illustrates file handling in Java, including creating a file if it does not exist, writing randomly generated numbers to the file, and reading back the data to display it to the user. It is an excellent example of working with files, generating random data, and basic input/output operations in Java.

#### Features
- Checks for the existence of a file named `data.file` and creates it if it does not exist.
- Writes 10 randomly generated numbers into the file, appending them if the file already exists.
- Reads and displays the contents of the file to the console.

#### How to Compile and Run
1. **Compiling the Program**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Change directory to where `FileCreation.java` is located.
   - Compile the program using:
     ```sh
     javac FileCreation.java
     ```

2. **Running the Program**
   - Execute the compiled class with:
     ```sh
     java FileCreation
     ```
   - The program will automatically handle file operations and output the results.

#### Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.
