# UseFans Class Implementation

## Overview
This lab focuses on enhancing the `Fan` class developed in Module 1 by creating a new class titled `UseFans`. It involves managing a collection of `Fan` instances and displaying their states without using the `toString()` method.

## Class Specifications

### UseFans Class
- **Collection of Fan Instances**:
  - Create a collection (like an ArrayList or a simple array) to store multiple instances of the `Fan` class.

- **Methods**:
  - **Display Collection Method**: Create a method that takes a collection of `Fan` instances and displays each fan's state without using the `toString()` method. This method should iterate over the collection and output the relevant attributes of each `Fan` instance.
  - **Display Single Fan Method**: Create another method that takes a single instance of a `Fan` and displays its state without using the `toString()` method. This method should directly access and display the individual attributes of the `Fan` instance.

- **Using 'this' Reference**:
  - Ensure that the `this` reference is used appropriately throughout the `Fan` class to refer to instance variables and methods.

### Test Code
- **Fan Instances Creation**:
  - Write test code that creates several `Fan` instances, initializing them with different states.

- **Display Functionality**:
  - Utilize the `UseFans` class methods to display the state of each `Fan` instance in the collection.
  - Demonstrate the functionality of the method that displays a single `Fan` instance.
